Global Rain is a software development and design firm that works with entrepreneurs, corporations, and government organizations all around the world. "Security is everyone's responsibility," the company's mission states. Using static testing, I was successful in discovering current vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is essential for preventing data theft and safeguarding the company's integrity and trustworthiness. The dependency check tool was quite useful, since it saved a lot of time by automatically discovering vulnerabilities rather than having to manually examine each dependent for flaws. Penetration testing will be required in the future to properly analyze vulnerabilities. If new dependencies were introduced, it was essential to re-run the dependency check. Otherwise, functionality may be assured by unit testing and human code review. I found the Internet to be really useful in researching current techniques and algorithms.
